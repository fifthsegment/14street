This app was developed as an entry for the app challenge by 14th Street Pizza organized by GDG Karachi.

#About our Design#
Our aim was to design an app with a simple yet interactive interface keeping in mind the original style of the 14th Street pizza as illustrated in their website. The app enables the user to cycle quickly through the steps involved in placing an order with ease without it seeming long and tedious. The app will then send the required order to an email address of the companies choice.

#Compatibility#
Our app is compatible with Android versions 2.2 (Froyo) and onwards, which means that it is compatible with more than 90% of all Android phones being used today, including more some economical models being used in Pakistan as well.

#The Good Stuff#
Our app opens on the main page that allows the user to select what kind of item they want to order. The user can select multiple items and customize their pizzas in an interactive very easy to use window that takes care of the whole pizza customization in one window without cramping the options on the screen.  We believe that you will be very impressed with our interface design.

One very important feature is that our app does not need any database backing, since your Email inbox will be the database. Since modern email services are great with managing inboxes so as more orders come they can archive the old ones, mark them as read, prioritize them etc. and since most people already do use email, there will be little to no training involved in dealing with new orders that are received in the inbox.

#Shortcomings#
Unfortunately we were late in discovering the competition and only had a few days to develop the app, however we have strived to make it as complete in functionality and as interactive as we could in the short time span. Also we did not have much time left over for testing hence the app is liable to contain bugs.
However, we are not just stopping here and would love to hear your recommendations and incorporate them in our app, and remove any bugs that remaining order to make this app perfect for you.
